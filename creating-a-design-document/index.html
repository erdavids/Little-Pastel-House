            <h2>Creating a Public Design Document for an Indie Game</h2>

            <p>Part of the excitement around developing a game is the opportunity to try new things. Each game presents a chance to practice new skills or experiment with different types of optimization. I like to imagine that the preperation and organization that supports the development of the game can be just as exciting. It's certainly a skill that you can either be good or bad at.</p>
         
            <p>For myself, I sometimes have to pull myself away from plugging away at code to actually plan the way that the game will be. For my current project, I took inspiration from some sources online and decided to create a public design document. The idea is to have a permanent place for people to see exactly what my intention is for the game, without completely spoiling all the potential surprises. I think having a document will help keep me accountable and give interested viewers the opportunity to provide more specific feedback.</p>
          
            <p>I'm approaching this as a newbie, so hopefully something useful will come of it.</p>

            <h3>The Platform</h3>

            <p>I don't have anything profound to say in this part, I feel like Google Sheets is a good place to host my document. It should be easy to distribute to others, and if the time comes that someone else needs to contribute, easy peasy.</p>
